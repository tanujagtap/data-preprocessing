1) Data Preprocessing â€” Zomato Dataset

This mini-project demonstrates basic preprocessing techniques used in preparing real-world datasets for machine learning.

Objective:
To clean and prepare the Zomato dataset by:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Splitting into train/test sets

Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (`SimpleImputer`, `LabelEncoder`, `train_test_split`)

Dataset:
A modified version of the Zomato restaurant dataset.

IMPORTANCE:
Before building ML models, proper preprocessing is crucial. This notebook showcases foundational steps that are required for almost any ML project.
